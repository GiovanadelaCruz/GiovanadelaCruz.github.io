        <h1>Educated Women and the Glass Ceiling:</h1>
        <h2>Breaking Through or Stuck?</h2>
        <p>
            Despite significant progress, a gender gap persists in the labor market.
            While many barriers still exit for most women, 
            it is important to examine this social issue in the context of educated women.
            <br>
            <br>
            This article explores the gender gap among women 
            who have already overcome numerous barriers to attain education and experience. 
            The focus is on their representation in executive roles, such as CEOs, 
            and in public institutions, as well as on the persistent gender wage gap.
            <br>
            <br>
            Is education enough to secure leadership positions?
            Is there a lack of qualified women to fill top leadership roles?
            And, perhaps most crucially, does the gender gap significantly correlate with economic growth?

            Among adults with advanced education, 
            labor force participation rates are expected to be equal for women and men. 
            However, a gender gap persists in most countries, including high-income economies.

                    When examining the relationship with GDP, a negative correlation emerges. 
                    Smaller participation gaps are associated with higher GDP per capita.

                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">
                    In OECD countries, women hold less than 50% of executive roles 
                    (including managerial and parliamentary positions), 
                    even in high-income economies. 
                    The gender gap is smaller in parliamentary roles in some countries, 
                    possibly due to laws regarding gender quotas.

    <section class="sections">   
        <h3 style="font-size: 18px">What about women in CEO positions?</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px;">
            A closer look at CEO roles shows that most enterprises are led by male CEOs. 
            In most countries, the proportion of enterprises with women as CEOs is less than 25%.
            Only in Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines do more than 40% of enterprises have a woman as CEO.
            However, this disparity is less pronounced in small enterprises but more significant in large companies.

                <h3 style="font-size: 18px">After women attain managerial positions, does the gender wage gap persist?</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">
                    It is reasonable to expect men and women in the same leadership roles to receive similar salaries. 
                    However, the gender wage gap—measured by the monthly wage difference 
                    as a percentage of male earnings—reveals substantial disparities. 
                    In high-income countries like Austria, female managers earn around 36% 
                    less than their male counterparts. 
                    Only in a few countries do women’s salaries closely align with those of men.

    <!-- SECTION 6 -->
    <section class="sections">   
        <h3 style="font-size: 18px">Is the gender gap in executive positions caused by a lack of women with advanced education?</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 280px; margin-right: 280px;">
            When examining the potential causes of this disparity, 
            the data on gender parity in tertiary education enrollment tells a different story. 
            Surprisingly, the share of women in advanced education has exceeded that of men 
            in many economies for decades. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For instance, the gender parity in tertiary education was achieved, on average, 
            in Latin America and the Caribbean by 1993, and in Europe and Central Asia by 1980. 
            This suggests that the lack of educated women is not necessarily the issue here.
